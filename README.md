# ft_containers

This project's goal is to implement some containers of STL in C++98.

## Implemented features
- vector
- map
- stack
- iterator
- enable_if

## What I've learned
- SFINAE(Substitution Failure Is Not An Error)
  - enable_if
- Internal structure of containers
  - vector: dynamically allocated array
  - map: RB tree
  - stack: linear container adaptor
- Exception guarantee
